    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>What I wanted to represent in this archive was to challenge the idea of archives. I believe this represents the topic of imaginary archives as they are meant to play with the ideas of archiving. This archive is a representation of an image gallery but with elements including, storytelling and play. As you scroll down and through this small weirdly formatted gallery it is supposed to invoke a sense of exploring sort of like visiting a real gallery. Given that strong sense of exploration, it provides a feeling of fun as you explore the different cats that this website has to offer. It is a fun way to instead of just looking at images on a screen. This is meant to be a concept and a tongue in cheek archive that plays to the strength of my humor and art style. Making browsing the web efficient and more fun is I think a great way to change up archives. Although this archive wouldnâ€™t be as efficient in being able to get through all the pages easily I think it is sufficient enough to navigate. Though it may be tedious I hope it allows viewers to enjoy their stay in this online archive.</p>
